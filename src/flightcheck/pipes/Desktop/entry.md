Add a "Desktop Entry" field to your desktop file

AppHub was able to find a `.desktop` file, but was unable to find a
`Desktop Entry` line. This line is extremely important as it tells the desktop
what command to run. Please add it to the desktop file and resubmit your
project.

For more information please look over these docs:
